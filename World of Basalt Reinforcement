Chetan Bhagat Launches World of Basalt Reinforcement by Mahesh Kumar Jogani

At a celebrity-filled event in Mumbai, renowned novelist and IIT graduate Chetan Bhagat contributed his voice to the sustainability cause by publishing Shri Mahesh Kumar Jogani’s book World of Basalt Reinforcement. The occasion united the fields of engineering, literature, and environmental awareness under one roof, signalling a turning point in the developing discourse on industrial development and sustainability.

Lauding the book, Bhagat emphasized its importance in today’s rapidly urbanizing world. “As an engineer, I see this work as not just timely but necessary. Sustainable materials are not a luxury—they are the need of the hour,” he said. He commended Jugani’s deep expertise and dedication to practical innovation in the reinforcement sector, particularly in crack control and structural durability.

A Book That Bridges Sustainability and Technology

World of Basalt Reinforcement introduces readers to basalt fiber—an advanced material derived from volcanic rock. Celebrated for its strength, corrosion resistance, and minimal environmental impact, basalt fiber is emerging as a serious alternative to traditional reinforcement materials like steel and glass fibers.

The book focuses on the synergy between nature and technology. It provides a detailed look at the formation and properties of basalt, followed by real-world applications ranging from Aerospace to automobile. With its clear explanations and real-life insights, the book serves as both an entry point for students and  introduction  guide for engineers and innovators.

The Author: A Career in Sustainable Innovation

Shri Mahesh Kumar Jogani brings over 20 years of experience to this work. A research engineer by profession and a techno-entrepreneur by passion, Jogani holds multiple patents and has led innovations across composites, industrial reinforcement, and material science. His work consistently emphasizes durability, efficiency, and environmental stewardship.

Jogani is best known for his hands-on approach and commitment to real-world solutions. His focus on crack control in concrete and reinforcement technologies has positioned him as a key voice in the advancement of sustainable construction methods. His belief in the transformative power of basalt fiber is evident throughout the book.

“My aim,” Jogani says, “is to make engineers think differently. Innovation doesn’t have to come at the cost of nature. With basalt, we can have both performance and environmental care and responsibility.” He added “With basalt, we can have both performance and sustainability”

As infrastructure demands rise globally and the climate crisis escalates, World of Basalt Reinforcement arrives at a critical juncture. It’s not just a technical manual—it’s a call to action for a new generation of builders, designers, and policymakers. The book resonates beyond construction. It reflects a broader shift in mindset—where innovation and sustainability are no longer seen as separate goals but as partners in progress.

Chetan Bhagat summed it up best: “This isn’t just a book for engineers—it’s a message for anyone who believes in a smarter, greener future.”
